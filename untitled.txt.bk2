INTRODUCTION


“In the autumn of 413 b.c. the news of the overwhelming
catastrophe in Sicily reached Athens, and the
''Lysistrata'' was written in the year 412, at the very darkest
period of the Peloponnesian War, the darkest, that is to
say, before the ultimate disaster of Aegospotami, and
the consequent fall of Athens. It was produced at the
commencement of the year 411 b.c., but whether at the
Lenaea or at the Great Dionysia, and with what success,
the scanty record which has come down to us contains
nothing to show.”[1]

In spite, however, of their difficulties, the Athenians
determined that they would not give in; they would
build a new navy in place of the fleets they had lost.
The sum of 1000 talents, held in reserve, was voted to
build the new fleet, timber and oar-spars being amongst
the articles most sorely needed, and amongst other
measures, “they appointed a Board of Ten Probuli, a
sort of Committee of Public Safety.”[2] (In the play the
Probulus commands the Scythian archers, whom elsewhere
we find attending upon the [Greek]; he comes to the
Acropolis to obtain the means of rebuilding the fleet; he
directs the [greek] to send plenipotentiaries to treat with
the Spartans.) “It was in a period of hopeless despondency
that Lysistrata developed her own original scheme
for a general pacification of the warring Hellenic states.”[3]

[Footnote 1: Rogers, Introduction, p. x.]

[Footnote 2: Ib. p. xi.]

[Footnote 3: Ib. p. xviii.]
-----File: 003.png---------------------------------------------------------

The Acropolis is an isolated rock, rising to a height of
about 500 feet above the level of the sea; the levelled
top measures some 1000 feet by 450 at the widest part.
This plateau the Pelasgians “surrounded by a wall ([greek]),
which lasted, apparently unaltered, till
the time of the Persian invasion.”[4] Then the wall was
thrown down, and it was rebuilt by Cimon; the southern
part is called Cimonian, the rest Pelasgian. “The entire
Acropolis was holy ground; and the numerous temples
which crowded it were all dominated by the triple presentment
of Athens as the [greek], the [greek], and the
[greek].”[5] The Erechtheum was the most ancient
temple in Athens, and it contained the sacred serpent
and the ancient wooden statue of Athene, to which the
Peplus used to be offered at the Great Panathenaea.
The Parthenon contained the famous gold-ivory statue of
Athena, by Pheidias. In the hinder cell of this temple
was the Athenian treasury. The Promachus was a
colossal image of bronze, which stood in the open air,
representing Athene armed and holding a spear. There
were many other temples and shrines in the precinct.

The Acropolis was approached by a sloping road, which
led to the Propylaea, or entry, of five gates. Near this,
outside the wall, was an intermittent spring known as
the Clepsydra and the grotto of Pan. The statues of
Harmodius and Aristogeiton stood near the foot of the
slope.

In this play Mr. Rogers prints text and translation
not side by side but separately, the translation for
obvious reasons being in many places only a paraphrase.

THE LYSISTRATA[6]

/P
Lysistrata. Now were they summoned to some shrine of Bacchus,
Pan, Colias, Genetyllis,[7] there had been
No room to stir, so thick the crowd of timbrels.
And now!--there’s not one woman to be seen.
Stay, here comes one, my neighbour Calonice.
Good morning, friend.

      CALONICE. Good morn, Lysistrata.
Why, what’s the matter? don’t look gloomy, child.
It don’t become you to knit-knot[8] your eyebrows.

Ly. My heart is hot within me, Calonice,
And sore I grieve for sake of womankind,
Because the men account us all to be
Sly, shifty rogues,

      CA. And so, by Zeus, we are.

Ly. Yet though I told them to be here betimes,
To talk on weighty business, they don’t come,
They’re fast asleep.

    CA. They’ll come, dear heart, they’ll come.
’Tis hard, you know, for women to get out.


[Footnote 6: ''It is daybreak at Athens; and Lysistrata, a young and
beautiful woman, is standing alone, with marks of evident anxiety
in her countenance and demeanour. The scene represents the
sloping hill which rises from the Lower to the Upper City. In the
background are the Propylaea, the splendid portals of the Athenian
Acropolis. Lysistrata is on the look-out for persons who do not
come, and after exhibiting various symptoms of impatience, she
suddenly begins to speak with abrupt and indignant emphasis.'']

[Footnote 7: “All Gods of Wine and Love, the chief pleasures, according
to Aristophanes, of the Athenian women”: R.]

[Footnote 8: The knit brows, two curves with a line between, are compared
to the double-curved bow with a hand-piece connecting them.]
-----File: 006.png---------------------------------------------------------
-----File: 007.png---------------------------------------------------------
One has to mind her husband: one, to rouse
Her servant: one, to put the child to sleep:
One, has to wash him: one, to give him pap.

Ly. Ah! but they've other duties still more pressing
Than such as these.

      CA. Well but, Lysistrata,
Why have you, dear, convoked us? Is the matter
A weighty subject?

      LY. Weighty? yes.

          CA. And pregnant?[9]

Ly. Pregnant, by Zeus.

CA. Why ever don’t we come, then?

ty. No, it’s not that: we’d have come fast enough
For such-like nonsense. ’Tis a scheme I’ve hit on,
Tossing it over many a sleepless night.

ca. Tossing it over? then ’tis light, I fancy.

Ly. Light? ay, so light, my dear, that all the hopes
Of all the States are anchored on us women.

ca. Anchored on us! a slender stay to lean on.

ty. Ay, all depends on us: whether as well the
Peloponnesians all shall cease to be--

ca. Sure and ’tis better they should cease to be.

Ly. And all the dwellers in Boeotia perish--

ca. Except the eels; do pray except the eels.[10]

Ly. But about Athens, mark you, I won't utter
Such words as these: you must supply my meaning.
But if the women will but meet here now,
Boeotian girls, Peloponnesian girls,
And we ourselves, we’ll save the States between us.

ca. What can we women do? What brilliant scheme
Can we, poor souls, accomplish? we who sit

Trimmed and bedizened[11] in our saffron silks,
Our cambric robes, and little finical shoes.

ly. Why, they’re the very things I hope will save us,
Your saffron dresses, and your finical shoes,
Your paints, and perfumes, and your robes of gauze.

ca. How mean you, save us?

      LY. So that nevermore
Men in our day shall lift the hostile spear--

ca. O, by the Twain,[12] I’ll use the saffron dye.

Ly. Or grasp the shield--

      CA. I’ll don the cambric robe.

Ly. Or draw the sword.

CA. I’ll wear the finical shoes.

Ly. Should not the women, then, have come betimes?

ca. Come? no, by Zeus; they should have flown with wings.

ly. Ah, friend, you’ll find them Attic to the core:
Always too late in everything they do.
Not even one woman from the coast has come,
Not one from Salamis.

      CA. O they, no doubt,
Will cross this morning, early, in their boats.[13]

Ly. And those I counted sure to come the first,
My staunch Acharnian damsels, they’re not here--
Not they.

    CA. And yet Theagenes’s wife
Consulted Hecate,[14] as if to come.[15]
Hi! but they’re coming now: here they all are:
First one, and then another. Hoity toity!

Whence come all these ?
Ly. From Anagyre.
CA. Aha!
We've stirred up Anagyre @ at all events.
MYRRHINA. Are we too late, Lysistrata? Well? What?
Why don’t you speak ?
LY. I’m sorry, Myrrhina,
That you should come so late on such a business.
my. I scarce could find my girdle in the dark.
But if the thing’s so pressing, tell us now.
LY. No, no, let’s wait a little, till the women
Of Peloponnesus and Boeotia come
To join our congress.
MY. O yes, better so.
And here, good chance, is Lampito approaching.®
Ly. O welcome, welcome, Lampito, my love.
O the sweet girl ! how hale and bright she looks !
Here’s nerve! here’s muscle! here’s an arm could
fairly
Throttle a bull!
LAMPITO. Weel, by the Twa,¢ I think sae.
An’ I can loup an’ fling an’ kick my hurdies.4
Ly. See here’s a neck and breast ; how firm and lusty !
La. Wow, but ye pradd me like a fatted calf.

La. Ane deputation frae Boeoty, comin’
To sit amang you.
LY. Ah, from fair Boeotia,
The land of plains !

You’d cleave, for Peace, your very self in twain ?

I’d walk through fire : only, not give up Love.

ty. O dearest friend ; my one true friend of all.
ca. Well, but suppose we do the things you say,
Pray Heaven avert it, but put case we do,
Shall we be nearer Peace ?

Powdered and trimmed, clad in our daintiest lawn,
Employing all our charms, and all our arts

the smoke and the flame of their torches. As the Men relapse into
silence, the voices of Women are heard in the distance. They come
sweeping round from the north side of the Acropolis, carrying their
pitchers of water, and singing, in turn, their entrance song. The
two Choruses are for the present concealed from each other by the
north-western angle of the Acropolis.

an active hand will lend us?
Well, well, I’m glad my back is freed
from all that weight tremendous.

Of flame this way, that I to-day

A trophy o’er these woman-hosts,

Slain by the old men’s hate.

¢ Men of this class were always ready to suspect a conspiracy
for setting upatyranny. Hippias, the last tvrant, after his brother
Hipparchus had been killed by Harmodius and Aristogeiton,
was expelled by the Alcmaeonidae with the help of Cleomenes,
king of Sparta. Cleisthenes is ‘‘ a fitting intermediary between
the Athenian women and the Laconian men, as partaking of the
nature of both’: R. See Thesm. 576. .

Strip to meet the great occasion,
vindicate our rights with me.
I can smell a deep, surprising
Tide of Revolution rising,
Odour as of folk devising
Hippias’s tyranny.?

Lest some false Laconians, meeting
in the house of Cleisthenes,
Have inspired these wretched women

Pay from whence I get my living.

taking citizens to task,
Prattling of a brassy buckler,

with Laconian men to deal,
Men of just the faith and honour
that a ravening wolf might feel !
Plots they're hatching, plots contriving,
plots of rampant Tyranny ;
But o’er us they shan’t be Tyrants,

Here beside Aristogeiton

’ These are the distinctions which a young Athenian girl might
hope to attain. Four girls, between the ages of seven and eleven,
were chosen yearly from those of noble birth to serve Athene for a
year in the Erechtheum; they were called appydépa because they
carried certain mysterious objects in caskets. The dderpides were
of ten years and upwards, also of noble birth, selected to grind on
the holy mills (iepot uuA@ves) grain for the sacred cakes. The
crowning honour was to carry a basket in the great Panathenaic
procession; A. 242, B. 1551, E. 730. Each Athenian girl, before
marriage, had to “‘ play the bear” at the festival of Brauronian
Artemis, wearing a yellow robe in place of the ancient bearskin:
