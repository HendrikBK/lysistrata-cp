THE LYSISTRATA, 1015-1031
She is wilder than a leopard,
she is fiercer than a fire.
w. cH. And yet you're so daft
as with women to contend,
When 'tis in your power to win me
and have me as a friend.
m.cH. I’ll never, never cease
all women to detest.
w. cH. That’s as you please hereafter :
meanwhile you're all undressed.
I really can’t allow it,
you are getting quite a joke ;
Permit me to approach you
and to put you on this cloak.
m. cH. Now that’s not so bad
or unfriendly I declare ;
It was only from bad temper
that I stripped myself so bare.
w. cH. There, now you look a man:
and none will joke and jeer you:
And if you weren't so spiteful
that no one can come near you,
I'd have pulled out the insect
that is sticking in your eye.
mM. cH. Ay, that is what’s consuming me,
that little biter-fly.2
Yes, scoop it out and show me,
when you've got him safe away :
The plaguy little brute,
he’s been biting me all day.
w.cH. I'll do it, sir, I'll do it:
but you're a cross one, you.
O Zeus ! here’s a monster
I am pulling forth to view.
