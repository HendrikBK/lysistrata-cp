THE LYSISTRATA, 329-354
What with the clatter of pitchers,
The noise and press of the throng,
Jostling with knaves and slaves,
Till at last I snatched it along,
Abundance of water supplying
To friends who are burning and dying.
Yea, for hither, they state,
Dotards are dragging, to burn us,
Logs of enormous weight,
Fit for a bath-room furnace,
Vowing to roast and to slay
Sternly the reprobate women.
O Lady, O Goddess, I pray,
Ne’er may I see them in flames !
I hope to behold them with gladness,
Hellas and Athens redeeming
from battle and murder and madness.
This is the cause why they venture,
Lady, thy mansions to hold,
Tritogeneia,* Eternal
Champion with helmet of gold !
And O, if with fire men invade them,
O help us with water to aid them.®
Stop! easy all! what have we here?
(To the men) You vile, abandoned crew,
No good and virtuous men, I’m sure,
would act in the way you do.
m.cH. Hey, here’s an unexpected sight !
hey, here’s a demonstration !
A swarm of women issuing out °
; with warlike preparation !
w.cH. Hallo, you seem a little moved !
does this one troop affright you ?
