THE LYSISTRATA, 578-593
Treat them as clots in the wool, and dissever them,
lopping the heads that are forming therein
Then you should card it, and comb it, and mingle it.
all in one Basket of love and of unity,
Citizens, visitors, strangers, and sojourners,
all the entire, undivided community.
Know you a fellow in debt to the Treasury ?
Mingle him merrily in with the rest.
Also remember the cities, our colonies,
outlying states in the east and the west,
Scattered about to a distance surrounding us,
these are our shreds and our fragments of wool ;
These to one mighty political aggregate
tenderly, carefully, gather and pull,
Twining them all in one thread of good fellowship ;
thence a magnificent bobbin to spin,
Weaving a garment of comfort and dignity,
worthily wrapping the People therein.
maG. Heard any ever the like of their impudence,
these who have nothing to do with the war,
Preaching of bobbins, and beatings, and washing-tubs?
LY. Nothing to do with it, wretch that you are !
We are the people who feel it the keenliest,
doubly on us the affliction is cast ;
Where are the sons that we sent to your battle-fields?
MAG. Silence ! a truce to the ills that are past.
Ly. Then in the glory and grace of our womanhood,
all in the May and the morning of life,
Lo, we are sitting forlorn and disconsolate,
what has a soldier to do with a wife ?
We might endure it, but ah! for the younger ones,
still in their maiden apartments they stay,
Waiting the husband that never approaches them,
watching the years that are gliding away.
