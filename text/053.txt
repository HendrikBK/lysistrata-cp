THE LYSISTRATA, 564-577
Off runs a shop-girl, appalled at the sight of him,
down he sits soldierly, gobbles her fruit.
maa. You, I presume, could adroitly and gingerly
settle this intricate, tangled concern:
You in a trice could relieve our perplexities.
LY. Certainly.
MAG. How ? permit me to learn.
Ly. Just as a woman, with nimble dexterity,
thus with her hands disentangles a skein,
Hither and thither her spindles unravel it,
drawing it out, and pulling it plain.
So would this weary Hellenic entanglement
soon be resolved by our womanly care,
So would our embassies neatly unravel it,
drawing it here and pulling it there.
mMaG. Wonderful, marvellous feats, not a doubt of it,
you with your skeins and your spindles can show ;
Fools ! do you really expect to unravel a
terrible war like a bundle of tow?
ty. Ah, if you only could manage your politics
just in the way that we deal with a fleece !4
maG. Tell us the recipe.
LY. First, in the washing-tub
plunge it, and scour it, and cleanse it from grease,
Purging away all the filth and the nastiness ;
then on the table expand it and lay,
Beating out all that is worthless and mischievous,
" picking the burrs and the thistles away.
Next, for the clubs, the cabals, and the coteries,
banding unrighteously, office to win,
struck off with sticks (éxpaSdifev). It is then washed, clots and
knots carded out with combs (édaéqvac), and the nuclei (kegaXas)
plucked out. It is now carded into the basket (xada@icxos,
represented in the state by xowy etvoa), and all the wool drawn
out (xdraypya, from xarayw) rolled into a ball ready for use (ro\v77).
