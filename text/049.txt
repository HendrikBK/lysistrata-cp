THE LYSISTRATA, 530-549
MAG. Silence for you ?
Stop for a wench with a wimple enfolding her ?
No, by the Powers, may I pir if I do!
LY. Do not, my pretty one, do not, I pray,
Suffer my wimple to stand in the way.
Here, take it, and wear it, and gracefully tie it,
Enfolding it over your head, and be quiet.
Now to your task.
CA. Here is an excellent spindle to pull.2
MY. Here is a basket for carding the wool.
LY. Now to your task.
Haricots chawing up,® pettiroats drawing up,
Off to yourcarding, your combing, your trimming,
War IS THE CARE AND THE BUSINESS OF WOMEN.°
w.cH. Up, up, and leave the pitchers there,
and on, resolved and eager,
Our own allotted part to bear
in this illustrious leaguer.
I will dance with resolute, tireless feet all day ;
My limbs shall never grow faint, my strength give
way ;
I will march all lengths with the noble hearts and
the true,
For theirs is the ready wit and the patriot hand,
And womanly grace, and courage to dare and do,
And Love of our own bright land.
Children of stiff and intractable grandmothers,
heirs of the stinging viragoes that bore you,?
woman : just as in the corresponding system, below, they bedeck
him in the habiliments of a corpse.
