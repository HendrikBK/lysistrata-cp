* 212-233 Nemo est sive adulter sive vir qui mihi ad amorem
paratus approprinquabit: (—papae, genua mihi solvuntur,
Lysistrata !)—et domi casta vitam degam, croceum gerens
vestimentum et ornatissima, ut vir meus quam maxime ardeat, et
numquam libens morem viro geram, et si invitae vim adhibebit,
vix dabo et motu non subsequar: non ad tectum crepidulas
extendam, non stabo ut leaena supra radulam [cyjjua suvoveias,
retpatodndov P. 896. Tupdxynors is a ‘ cheese-grater,” but these
were very dissimilar to our “graters,” being a sort of knife
with a bronze or ivory handle, and it was common to carve
figures of animals on such handles].

> Lysistrata takes the wine-cup in her hand.
