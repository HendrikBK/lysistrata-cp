THE LYSISTRATA, 355-371
You see not yet the myriadth part
of those prepared to fight you.
m.cH. Now, really, Phaedrias, shall we stop
to hear such odious treason ?
Let’s break our sticks about their backs,
let’s beat the jades to reason.
w.cH. Hi, sisters, set the pitchers down,
and then they won't embarrass
Our nimble fingers, if the rogues
attempt our ranks to harass.
M.cH. I warrant, now, if twice or thrice
we slap their faces neatly,
That they will learn, like Bupalus,?
to hold their tongues discreetly.
w.cH. Well, here’s my face : I won't draw back :
now slap it if you dare,
And I won't leave one ounce of you
for other dogs to tear.
mM. cH. Keep still, or else your musty Age
to very shreds I'll batter.
w. cu. Now only touch Stratyllis, sir ;
just lift one finger at her!
m.cH. And what if with these fists, my love,
I pound the wench to shivers ?
w.cH. By Heaven, we'll gnaw your entrails out,
and rip away your livers.
m.cH. There is not than Euripides
a bard more wise and knowing,
For women ARE a shameless set,
, the vilest creatures going.’
w.cH. Pick up again, Rhodippe dear,
your jug with water brimming.
mM.cH. What made you bring that water here,
you God-detested women ?
