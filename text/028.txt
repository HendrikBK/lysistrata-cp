And if our summons they reject,
and keep the barriers shut,
We'll burn the very doors with fire,
and them with smoke we'll smother.
So lay the burdens down. Pheugh! Pheugh!
O how this smoke does bother !
What general from the Samian @ lines
an active hand will lend us?
Well, well, I’m glad my back is freed
from all that weight tremendous.
O pot, tis now your turn to help:
O send a livelier jet
Of flame this way, that I to-day
the earliest light may get.
O Victory, immortal Queen,?
assist us Thou in rearing
A trophy o’er these woman-hosts,
so bold and domineering.
CHORUS OF WOMEN.
Redly up in the sky
the flames are beginning to flicker,
Smoke and vapour of fire !
come quicker, my friends, come quicker.
Fly, Nicodice, fly, .
Else will Calyce burn,
Else Critylla will die,
Slain by the laws so stern,
Slain by the old men’s hate.
Ah, but I fear! I fear!
can it chance that I come too late ?
Trouble it was, forsooth, before my jug I could fill,
All in the dusk of the morn,
at the spring by the side of the hill,4
