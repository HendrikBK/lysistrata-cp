THE LYSISTRATA, 745-769
T.W. But to-day I am
Quick, let me pass, Lysistrata, at once
To find a midwife.
LY. What’s it all about ?
What's this hard lump ?
T.W. That’s a male child.
LY. Not it.
It’s something made of brass, and hollow too.
Come, come. out with it. O you silly woman,
What ! cuddling up the sacred helmet ¢ there
And say you're pregnant ?
T.W. Well, and so I am.
Ly. What’s this for then ?
T.W. Why, if my pains o’ertake me
In the Acropolis, I’d creep inside
And sit and hatch there as the pigeons do.
Ly. Nonsense and stuff: the thing’s as plain as can be
Stay and keep here the name-day of your—helmet.
FOURTH W. But I can’t sleep a single wink up here,
So scared I was to see the holy serpent.
FIFTH Ww. And I shall die for lack of rest, I know,
With this perpetual hooting of the owls.
LY. O ladies, ladies, cease these tricks, I pray.
Ye want your husbands. And do you suppose
They don’t want us? Full wearisome, I know,
Their nights without us. O bear up, dear friends,
Be firm, be patient, yet one little while,
For I’ve an oracle (here ’tis) which says
We're sure to conquer if we hold together.
WOMEN. O read us what it says.
LY. Then all keep silence.°
* The sacred serpent dwelt in the Erechtheum.
¢ Lysistrata reads out the oracle.
