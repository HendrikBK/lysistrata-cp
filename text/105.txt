THE LYSISTRATA, 1176-1200
So if ye would, go and consult together
And talk it over, each with your allies.

ATH. Allies, says she! Now my good soul consider :
What do they want, what can they want, but this,
Their wives again ?

LAC. The fient anither wiss
Ha’ mine, I ween.

ATH. Nor my Carystians @ either.

Ly. O that is well: so purify yourselves ;

And in the Acropolis we'll feast you all

On what our cupboards still retain in store.
There, each to other, plight your oath and troth,
Then every man receive his wife again,

And hie off homeward

ATH. That we will, and quickly.

Lac. Gaeon: we’se follow.?

ATH... Ay, as quick as quick.°

CH. Gorgeous robes and golden trinkets,

Shawls and mantles rich and rare,

I will lend to all who need them,
Lend for youths to wear,

Or if any comrade’s daughter
Would the Basket bear.

One and all J here invite you,

Freely of my goods partake,

Nought is sealed so well, but boldly
Ye the seals may break,

And of all that lurks behind them,

to be one of the pre-Hellenic populations, Thuc. vii. 57. Three

hundred of them were in the service of the Four Hundred at Athens,

Thuc. viii. 69. Probably they were of savage manners.
