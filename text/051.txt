On, with an eager, unyielding tenacity,
wind in your sails, and the haven before you.
LY. Only let Love, the entrancing, the fanciful,
only let Queen Aphrodite to-day
Breathe on our persons a charm and a tenderness,
lend us their own irresistible sway,
Drawing the men to admire us and long for us ;
then shall the war everlastingly cease,
Then shall the people revere us and honour us,
givers of Joy, and givers of Peace.*
maG. Tell us the mode and the means of your doing it.
LY. First we will stop the disorderly crew,
Soldiers in arms promenading and marketing.
ST. Yea, by divine Aphrodite, ’tis true.
Ly. |Nowinthe market? you see them like Corybants,¢
jangling about with their armour of mail.
Fiercely they stalk in the midst of the crockery,
sternly parade by the cabbage and kail.
mac. Right, for a soldier should always be soldierly !
LY. Troth, ‘tis a mighty ridiculous jest,
Watching them haggle for shrimps in the market-
place,
grimly accoutred with shield and with crest.
st. Lately I witnessed a captain of cavalry,
proudly the while on his charger he sat,
Witnessed him, soldierly, buying an omelet,
stowing it all in his cavalry hat.
Comes, like a Tereus, a Thracian irregular,4
shaking his dart and his target to boot ;
® The crockery and vegetable stalls: Schol.
¢ Phrygian priests of Cybele, who went armed. The Gorgon
head (560) was a device on the shield.
¢ Tereus, the fabulous king of Thrace. The Thracians were
engaged as mercenaries.
