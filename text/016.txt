THE LYSISTRATA, 136-161
MY. I'd liefer walk through fire.
Ly. O women! women! O our frail, frail-sex |<" °
No wonder tragedies are made from us.
Always the same: nothing but loves and cradles.*
O friend! O Lampito! if you and I
Are of one mind, we yet may pull things through ;
Won’t you vote with me, dear ?
LA. Haith, by the Twa’,
’Tis sair to bide your lane, withouten men.
Still it maun be : we maun hae Peace, at a’ risks.
ty. O dearest friend ; my one true friend of all.
ca. Well, but suppose we do the things you say,
Pray Heaven avert it, but put case we do,
Shall we be nearer Peace ?
LY. Much, much, much nearer.
For if we women will but sit at home,
Powdered and trimmed, clad in our daintiest lawn,
Employing all our charms, and all our arts
To win men’s love, and when we’ve won it, then
Repel them, firmly, till they end the war,
We'll soon get Peace again, be sure of that.
LA. Sae Menelaus, when he glowered, I ween,
At Helen’s breastie, coost his glaive awa’.?
ca. Eh, but suppose they leave us altogether ?
Ly. O, faddle! then we’ll find some substitute.°
® After the fall of Troy, Menelaus, about to slay Helen,
was softened by the sight of her beauty. See Tennyson’s
Lucretius.
¢ Lines 158-163 are: ‘*Then, as P. said, canem excoriatum
excoriare.’’ ‘Those imitations are rubbish. But what if they
drag us into the room by force?’ ‘Cling to the door.” ‘* What
ifthey beatus?”’ ‘ Yield witha bad grace, for there is no pleasure
in what is taken by force.’’—Pherecrates is unknown. The words
xuva 6. 6. were used as a proverb émiray parny rovotvrwr, but there
is a reference to the penis coriaceus of 109.
