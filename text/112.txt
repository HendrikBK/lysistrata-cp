THE LYSISTRATA, 1275-1303
And you, take these ; then standing side by side,
Each by his partner, lead your dances out
In grateful honour to the Gods, and O
Be sure you nevermore offend again.
CH. Now for the Chorus, the Graces, the minstrelsy.
Call upon Artemis, queen of the glade :
Call on her brother, the Lord of festivity,
Holy and gentle one, mighty to aid.
Call upon Bacchus, afire with his Maenades ;
Call upon Zeus, in the lightning arrayed ;
Call on his queen, ever blessed, adorable ;
Call on the holy, infallible Witnesses,*
Call them to witness the peace and the harmony,
This which divine Aphrodite has made.
Allala! Lallala! Lallala, Lallala !
Whoop for victory, Lallalalae !
Evoi! Evoi! Lallala, Lallala !
Evae! Evae! Lallalalae.
Our excellent new song is done ;
Do you, Laconian, give us one.
tac.2) Leave Taygety, an’ quickly
Hither, Muse Laconian, come.
Hymn the Gude o’ braw Amyclae,
Hymn Athana, Brassin-dome.
Hymn the Tyndarids, for ever
Sportin’ by Eurotas river.
Noo then, noo the step begin,
