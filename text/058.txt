THE LYSISTRATA, 614-634
m.cH. This is not a time for slumber ;
now let all the bold and free,
Strip to meet the great occasion,
vindicate our rights with me.
I can smell a deep, surprising
Tide of Revolution rising,
Odour as of folk devising
Hippias’s tyranny.?
And I feel a dire misgiving,
Lest some false Laconians, meeting
in the house of Cleisthenes,
Have inspired these wretched women
| all our wealth and pay to seize,
Pay from whence I get my living.
Gods ! to hear these shallow wenches
taking citizens to task,
Prattling of a brassy buckler,
jabbering of a martial] casque !
Gods ! to think that they have ventured
with Laconian men to deal,
Men of just the faith and honour
that a ravening wolf might feel !
Plots they're hatching, plots contriving,
plots of rampant Tyranny ;
But o’er us they shan’t be Tyrants,
no, for on my guard I'll be,
And I'll dress my sword in myrtle,?
and with firm and dauntless hand,
Here beside Aristogeiton
resolutely take my stand,
Marketing in arms beside him.
This the time and this the place
