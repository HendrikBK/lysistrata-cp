Can endure such pangs of despair.
cl. O Zeus, what pangs and throes I bear !
mM.cH. All this woe she has wrought you, she only, the
Utterly hateful, the utterly vile.
w.cH. Not so; but the darling, the utterly sweet.
M.CH. Sweet, sweet, do youcall her? Vile, vile, I repeat.
Zeus, send me a storm and a whirlwind, I pray,
To whisk her away, like a bundle of hay,
Up, up, to the infinite spaces,
And toss her and swirl her, and twist her, and twirl
her,
Till, tattered and torn, to the earth she is borne,
To be crushed—in my ardent embraces.
