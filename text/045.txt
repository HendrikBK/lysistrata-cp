THE LYSISTRATA, 501-514
MAG. But how if I wish it not ?
LY. That will but make our resolve the completer.
MAG. Fools! what on earth can possess you to meddle with
matters of war, and matters of peace ?
ty. Well, I will tell you the reason.
MAG. And speedily,
else you will rue it.
LY. Then listen, and cease
Clutching and ¢lenching your fingers so angrily ;
keep yourself peaceable.
MAG. Hanged if I can ;
Such is the rage that I feel at your impudence.
ST, Then it is you that will rue it, my man.
maG. Croak your own fate, you ill-omened antiquity.
(To Lysistrata) You be the spokeswoman, lady.
LY. I will.
Think of our old moderation and gentleness,
think how we bore with your pranks, and were
still,
All through the days of your former pugnacity,
all through the war that is over and spent :
Not that (be sure) we approved of your policy ;
never our griefs you allowed us to vent.
Well we perceived your mistakes and mismanage-
ment.
Often at home on our housekeeping cares,
Often we heard of some foolish proposal you
made for conducting the public affairs.
Then would we question you mildly and pleasantly,
inwardly grieving, but outwardly gay ;
Husband, how goes it abroad 2? we would ask of him ;
what have ye done in Assembly to-day ?
What would ye write on the side of the Treaty stone ¢ ?
Husband says angrily, Vhat’s that to you ?
