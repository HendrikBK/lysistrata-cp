THE LYSISTRATA, 488-501
LY. Keeping the silver securely in custody,
lest for its sake ye continue the war.
Mac. What, is the war for the sake of the silver, then ?
LY. Yes ; and all other disputes that there are.
Why is Peisander? for ever embroiling us,
why do the rest of our officers feel
Always a pleasure in strife and disturbances ?
Simply to gain an occasion to steal.
Act as they please for the future, the treasury
never a penny shall yield them, I vow.
mac. How, may I ask, will you hinder their getting it ?
LY. We will ourselves be the Treasurers now.
MaG. You, woman, you be the treasurers ?
LY. Certainly.
Ah, you esteem us unable, perchance !
Are we not skilled in domestic economy,
do we not manage the household finance ?
mac. O, that is different.
LY. Why is it different ?
MAG. This is required for the fighting, my dear.
ty. Well, but the fighting itself isn’t requisite.
MAG. Only, without it, we’re ruined, I fear.
ty. WE will deliver you.
MAG. You will deliver us !
LY. Truly we will.
MAG. What a capital notion !
ty. Whether you like it or not, we'll deliver you.
MAG. Impudent hussy !
LY. You seem in commotion.
Nevertheless we will do as we promise you.
MAG. That were a terrible shame, by Demeter.
ty. Friend, we must save you.
* A politician who advocated war for his own private gain. He
was at the time scheming to overthrow the democracy. P. 394.
