THE LYSISTRATA, 1151-1175
And stood beside you in the fight alone,
And slew full many a stout Thessalian trooper,
Full many of Hippias’s friends and helpers,
And freed the State, and gave your people back
The civic mantle for the servile skirt ?
Lac. Danged, an’ there ever waur a bonnier lassie !
aTH. Hanged if I ever saw so sweet a creature !
ty. Such friends aforetime, helping each the other,
What is it makes you fight and bicker now?
Why can’t ye come to terms? Why can’t ye, hey?
Lac. Troth an’ we're willin’, gin they gie us back
Yon girdled neuk.?
ATH. What’s that ?
LAC. Pylus, ye ninny,
Whilk we've been aye langin’ an’ graipin’ for.
atu. No, by Poseidon, but you won’t get that.
Ly. O let them have it, man.
ATH. How can we stir
Without it?
LY. Ask for something else instead.
aTH. Hum! haw! let’s see; suppose they give us back
Echinus first, then the full-bosomed gulf
Of Melis, then the straight Megaric limbs.
tac. Eh, mon, yee daft ; ye'll no hae everything.
ty. Oletit be: don’t wrangle about the limbs.
aTH. I’fecks, I'd like to strip, and plough my field.?
tac. An’I to bring the midden, by the Twa.
ty. All this ye’ll do, when once ye come to terms.
