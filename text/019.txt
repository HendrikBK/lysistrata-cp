THE LYSISTRATA, 188~218
(Like those Seven Chiefs in Aeschylus) ¢ a lamb
Over a shield.
CA. Nay, when our object’s Peace,
Don’t use a shield, Lysistrata, my dear.
ty. Then what shall be the oath ?
CA. Could we not somehow
Get a grey mare,? and cut her up to bits ?
ty. Grey mare, indeed !
CA. Well, what’s the oath will suit
Us women best ?
MY. I'll tell you what I think.
Let’s set a great black cup here, hollow upwards : ¢
Then for a lamb we'll slay a Thasian wine-jar,
And firmly swear to—pour no water in.
La. Hech, the braw aith! my certie, hoo I like it.
ty. O yes, bring out the wine-jar and the cup.?
ca. La! here’s a splendid piece of ware, my dears.
Now that’s a cup ‘twill cheer one’s heart to take.
LY. (to the servant) Set down the cup, and take the victim
boar.°
O Queen Persuasion, and O Loving Cup,
Accept our offerings, and maintain our cause ! /
ca. ‘Tis jolly coloured blood, and spirts out bravely 9
La. Ay, an’ by Castor, vera fragrant too !
my. Let me swear first, my sisters ?
CA. Yes, if you
Draw the first lot ; not else, by Aphrodite.’

¢ ‘* She means the Wine-jar, but she speaks of it as a victim
whose blood is about to be shed”: R.

! The servant pours the wine into the cup, the women all pressing
round to see.

¢ She uses a sacrificial formula: Schol. o7rééde.= rpocdtet.

» “ Since the first to swear would have the first drink’: Schol.
At a symposium, the president was determined by lot, and some-
times the order of drinking.
