Ww. Shall I give your check a blow ?
M. No, I thank you, no. no, no’!
Ww. Hoist my foot and kick you too?
M. Fie! what vulgar feet ¢ I view.
Ww. Vulgar feet! absurd, absurd,
Don't such foolish things repeat ;
Never were, upon my word,
Tinier, tidier little feet.®
ty. Ho, ladies! ladies! quick, this way, this way !
F.w. O what's the matter and what means that cry ?
ty. Aman! aman! [I see a man approaching
Wild with desire, beside himself with love.
F.w. O lady of Cyprus, Paphos, and Cythera,
Keep on, straight on, the way you are going now !
But where’s the man?
LY. (pointing) Down there, by Chloé’s chapel.°
F.Ww. Oso he is: whoever can he be!
LY. Know you him, anyone ?
MY. O yes, my dear,
I know him. That’s Cinesias, my husband.
ty. O then ’tis yours to roast and bother him well ;
Coaxing, yet coy : enticing, fooling him,
Going all lengths, save what our Oath forbids.
My. Ay, ay, trust me.
LY. And I'll assist you, dear ;
I'll take my station here, and help befool
And roast our victim. All the rest, retire.?
cinEsIaS. O me! these pangs and paroxysms of love,
is again a short pause. Suddenly the voice of Lysistrata is heard
calling eagerly to her friends.
¢ Near the Acropolis. Demeter was called Chloé after the first
green corn-shoots (x67). ;
4 The others withdraw, leaving Lysistrata alone upon the wall.
Cinesias approaches underneath.
