THE LYSISTRATA, 1125-1150
I’m of myself not badly off for brains,*
And often listening to my father’s words
And old men’s talk, I’ve not been badly schooled.
And now, dear friends, I wish to chide you both,
That ye, all of one blood, all brethren sprinkling
The selfsame altars from the selfsame laver,
At Pylae, Pytho, and Olympia,® ay
And many others which ‘twere long to name,
That ye, Hellenes—with barbarian foes
Armed, looking on—fight and destroy Hellenes !
So far one reprimand includes you both.
aTH. And I, I’m dying all for love, sweetheart.
ty. And ye, Laconians, for I'll turn to you,
Do ye not mind how Pericleidas ° came,
(His coat was scarlet but his cheeks were white),
And sat a suppliant at Athenian altars
And begged for help? “T'was when Messene pressed
Weighing you down, and God’s great earthquake too.
And Cimon went, Athenian Cimon went
With his four thousand men, and saved your State.
And ye, whom Athens aided, now in turn
Ravage the land which erst befriended you.
ATH. Fore Zeus they're wrong, they're wrong, Lysistrata
tac. O ay, we're wrang, but she’s a braw ane, she.
ty. And you, Athenians, think ye that I mean
To let You off? Do ye not mind, when ye
Wore skirts of hide, how these Laconians # came

* See Plutarch, Cimon, chap. xvi.; Thue. i. 102, iii. 54. In
464 B.c. an earthquake devastated Sparta, and the Helots revolted
and took refuge in the fortress of Ithome. P. was sent to Athens
for help and received it.

@ See Hdt. v. 64,65. They sent help to expel the tyrants from
Athens. Under the tyrants, certain returned exiles had been
allowed to stay in Attica but not to enter Athens, and com-
pelled to wear the rough dress bordered with sheepskin (karwvdxy)
of slaves or labourers, so as to identify them.
