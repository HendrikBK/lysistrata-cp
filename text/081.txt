THE LYSISTRATA, 896-918
ct. Not care, although the fowls are in the house
Pulling your threads to pieces ?
MY. Not a bit.
c1. Nor though the sacred rites of wedded love
Have been so long neglected ? won't you come ?
my. No, no, I won't, unless you stop the war,
And all make friends.
cl. Well, then, if such your will,
We'll e’en do this.
MY. Well, then, if such your will,
I'll e’en come home: but now I’ve sworn I won't.
c1.¢ Come to my arms, do, after all this time!
my. No, no—and yet I won't say I don’t love you.
ct. You love me? then come to my arms, my dearie !
my. You silly fellow, and the baby here ?
c1. O,not at all—(to slave) here, take the baby home.
There now: the baby’s gone out of the way ;
Come to my arms!
MY. Good heavens, where, I ask you!
ci. Pan’s grotto® will do nicely.
MY. Oh, indeed !
- How shall I make me pure to ascend the Mount ?
cr. Easy enough: bathe in the Clepsydra.
my. I’ve sworn an oath, and shall I break it, man ?
c1. On my head be it: never mind the oath.
my. Well, let me bring a pallet.
cl. Not at all;
The ground will do.
MY. What—one so much to me?
I swear I'll never let you lie o’ the ground.4
’ ** Pan’s grotto was to be the nuptial chamber, and she was
to purify herself in the adjoining spring, the Clepsydra”: R.
