e THE LYSISTRATA, 44-66
Trimmed and bedizened @ in our saffron silks,
Our cambric robes, and little finical shoes.
ty. Why, they're the very things I hope will save us,
Your saffron dresses, and your finical shoes,
Your paints, and perfumes, and your robes of gauze.
ca. How mean you, save us ?
LY. So that nevermore
Men in our day shall lift the hostile spear—
ca. O, by the Twain,? I’ll use the saffron dye.
Ly. Or grasp the shield—
CA. I'll don the cambric robe.
Ly. Or draw the sword.
CA. I'll wear the finical shoes.
Ly. Should not the women, then, have come betimes ?
ca. Come? no, by Zeus; they should have flown with wings.
ty. Ah, friend, you'll find them Attic to the core :
Always too late in everything they do.
Not even one woman from the coast has come,
Not one from Salamis.
CA. O they, no doubt,
Will cross this morning, early, in their boats.
Ly. And those I counted sure to come the first,
My staunch Acharnian damsels, they’re not here—
Not they.
CA. And yet Theagenes’s wife
Consulted Hecate,? as if to come.¢
Hi! but they’re coming now: here they all are:
First one, and then another. Hoity toity !
Such jests seem to have had some special connexion with Salamis ;
cf. 411, E. 38.

4 T. used never to leave home without consulting the shrine of
Hecate at his house door. Here his superstition is transferred to
his wife ; see IV. 804.

* Several women enter, headed by Myrrhina, from the village of
Anagyrus. Others soon follow.
