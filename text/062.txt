THE LYSISTRATA, 654-676
Dotards, ye have lost and wasted !
nothing in its stead ye bring.
Nay ourselves ye're like to ruin,
spend and waste by blundering.
Murmuring are ye? Let me hear you,
only let me hear you speak,
And from this unpolished slipper
comes a—slap upon your cheek !
M CH. Is not this an outrage sore ?
And methinks it blows not o’er,
But increases more and more.
Come, my comrades, hale and hearty,
on the ground your mantles throw,
In the odour of their manhood
men to meet the fight should go,
Not in these ungodly wrappers
swaddled up from top to toe.
On, then on, my white-foot* veterans,
ye who thronged Leipsydrium’s height
In the days when we were Men!
Shake this chill old Age from off you,
Spread the wings of youth again.
O these women! give them once a
handle howsoever small,
And they'll soon be nought behind us
in the manliest feats of all.
Yea, they'll build them fleets and navies
and they'll come across the sea,
Come like Carian Artemisia,°
fighting in their ships with me.
Or they'll turn their first attention, _
haply, to equestrian fights,
