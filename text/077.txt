THE LYSISTRATA, 846-869
Riving my heart, keen as a torturer’s wheel !
ty. Who’s this within the line of sentries ?
cl. I.
ty. Aman?
Cl. A man, no doubt.
LY. Then get you gone.
ct. Who bids me go?
LY. I, guard on outpost duty.
c1. Ocall me out, I pray you, Myrrhina.
Ly. Call you out Myrrhina! And who are you ?
c1. Why, I’m her husband, I’m Cinesias.¢
Ly. O welcome, welcome, dearest man; your name
Is not unknown nor yet unhonoured here.
Your wife for ever has it on her lips.
She eats no egg, no apple, but she says
This to Cinesias !
Cl. O, good heaven ! good heaven!
Ly. She does, indeed: and if we ever chance
To talk of men, she vows that all the rest
Are veriest trash beside Cinesias.
ct. Ah! call her out.
Ly. And will you give me aught ?
ct. O yes, I'll give you anything I’ve got.?
ty. Then I'll go down and call her.¢
cl. Pray be quick.
I have no joy, no happiness in life,
Since she, my darling, left me. When I enter
My vacant home I weep; and all the world
Seems desolate and bare : my very meals
Give me no joy, now Myrrhina is gone.

9 There was an Attic deme IIa:ovldar, but Ilacovidns is intended
to suggest maiew as Kwyoias does xiveiv, a verb of the same signifi-
cation.
