THE LYSISTRATA, 770 792
Soon as the snallon's are seen
collecting and crouching together.
Shunning the hoopoes’ flight
and keeping aloof from the Love-birds,*
Cometh a rest from ill,
and Zeus the Lord of the Thundeg
Changeth the upper to under.
w. Preserve us, shall we be the upper ?
ty. Nay, but if once they wrangle,
and flutter away in dissension
Out of the Temple of God,
then all shall see and acknonledge,
Never a bird of the air
so perjured and frail” as the swallow.
w. Wow, but that’s plain enough! O all ye Gods,
Let us not falter in our efforts now.
Come along in. O friends, O dearest friends,
"Twere sin and shame to fail the oracle.¢
M. CH. Now to tell a little story
Fain, fain I, grow,
One I heard when quite an urchin
Long, long ago.4
How that once
Allgo shun the nuptial bed
From his home Melanion fled,
To the hills and deserts sped,
Kept his dog,
Wove his snares,
Set his nets,
Trapped his hares ;
Home he nevermore would go,

4 The Men reverse the story, in which Atalanta fled from wed-
lock, and Melanion won her by the golden apples (so Schol.);
Apollodorus iii. 9. 6.
