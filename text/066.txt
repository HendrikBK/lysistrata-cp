THE LYSISTRATA, 700-723
So that when in Hecate’s honour
yesterday I sent to get
From our neighbours in Boeotia
such a dainty darling pet,
Just a lovely, graceful, slender,
white-fleshed eel divinely tender,?
Thanks to your decrees, confound them,
one and all refused to send her.
And you'll never stop from making
these absurd decrees I know,
Till I catch your leg and toss you
—Zeus-ha’-mercy, there you go!?
w. cH. Illustrious leader of this bold emprize,°
What brings thee forth, with trouble in thine eyes ?
Ly. Vile women’s works: the feminine hearts they show:
These make me pace, dejected, to and fro.
w. cH. O what! and O what!
LY. "Tis true! ’tis true !
w. cH. O to your friends, great queen, the tale unfold.
LY. Tis sad to tell, and sore to leave untold.
w.cH. What, what has happened ? tell us, tell us quick.
LY. Aye, in one word. The girls are—husband-sick.
w.cH. O Zeus! Zeus! O!
ty. Why call on Zeus? the fact is surely so.
I can no longer keep the minxes in.
They slip out everywhere. One I discovered
Down by Pan’s grotto, burrowing through the
loophole : 4 °
Another, wriggling down by crane and pulley ¢:
A third deserts outright : a fourth T dragged
¢ The grotto is in the north-west face of the Acropolis rock, and
a path now leads down to it through a closed doorway.
¢ These belonged to the well : Schol.
