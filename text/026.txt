THE LYSISTRATA, 287-309
Ere we reach our goal at the Castle keep,
We've still, with our burdensome load, to creep.
And how to manage that blunt incline
Without a donkey, I can’t divine.
Dear, how these two great firelogs make
. my wearied shoulders toil and ache.
But still right onward we needs must go,
And still the cinders we needs must blow,
Else we'll find the fire extinguished,
ere we reach our journey’s end.
Puff! Puff! Puff!
O the smoke! the smoke! :
O royal Heracles! what a lot
Of fire came raging out of the pot,
And flew, like a dog, at my eyes, red hot.
"Twas a jet from the Lemnian? mines, I ween,
It came so fierce, and it bit so keen,
And worried, with persistence sore,
my two poor eyes, inflamed before.
On, Laches, on! to the castle press,
And aid the God in her dire distress ;
Surely, if we e’er would help her,
now’s the very time, my friend.
Puff! Puff! Puff!
O the smoke! the smoke!
Thank heaven the fire is still alight,
and burning beautifully bright.
So here we'll lay our burdens down,
with eager hearts delighted,
And dip the vine-torch in the pot,
and get it there ignited.
Then all together at the gates
like battering rams we'll butt.
