INTRODUCTION

The Acropolis is an isolated rock, rising to a height of
about 500 feet above the level of the sea; the levelled
top measures some 1000 feet by 450 at the widest part.
This plateau the Pelasgians “ surrounded by a wall (7d
IleAacytxov), which lasted, apparently unaltered, till
the time of the Persian invasion.’’* Then the wall was
thrown down, and it was rebuilt by Cimon ; the southern
part is called Cimonian, the rest Pelasgian. ‘‘ The entire
Acropolis was holy ground ; and the numerous temples
which crowded it were all dominated by the triple pre-
sentment of Athens as the IloAcas, the Ilap@evos, and the
IIpopaxos.”® The Erechtheum was the most ancient
temple in Athens, and it contained the sacred serpent
and the ancient wooden statue of Athene, to which the
Peplus used to be offered at the Great Panathenaea.
The Parthenon contained the famous gold-ivory statue of
Athena, by Pheidias. In the hinder cell of this temple
was the Athenian treasury. The Promachus was a
colossal image of bronze, which stood in the open air,
representing Athene armed and holding a spear. There
were many other temples and shrines in the precinct.

The Acropolis was approached by a sloping road, which
led to the Propylaea, or entry, of five gates. Near this,
outside the wall, was an intermittent spring known as
the Clepsydra and the grotto of Pan. The statues of
Harmodius and Aristogeiton stood near the foot of the
slope.

In this play Mr. Rogers prints text and translation
not side by side but separately, the translation for
obvious reasons being in many places only a paraphrase.
