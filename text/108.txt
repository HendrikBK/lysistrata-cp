THE LYSISTRATA, 1223-1246
Come, come, begone ; that these Laconians here,
The banquet ended, may depart in peace.?
F.ATH. Well, if I ever saw a feast like this !
What cheery fellows those Laconians were,
And we were wondrous witty in our cups.

SEC.ATH. Ay, ay, ‘tis when we're sober, we're so daft.
Now if the State would take a friend’s advice,
"Twould make its envoys always all get drunk.
When we go dry to Sparta, all our aim
Is just to see what mischief we can do.

We don’t hear aught they say ; and we infer

A heap of things they never said at all.

Then we bring home all sorts of differing tales.

Now everything gives pleasure : if a man,

When he should sing Cleitagora, strike up

With Telamon’s song,® we'd clap him on the back,

And say ‘twas excellent ; ay, and swear it too.°
por. Why, bless the fellows, here they come again,

Crowding along. Be off, you scoundrels, wil] you ?
1p. By Zeus, we must: the guests are coming out.?
tac. O lovey mine, tak’ up the pipes an’ blaw.

An’ [’se jist dance @ an’ sing a canty sang

Anent the Athanians an’ our ainsells too.

aTH. Ay, by the Powers, take up the pipes and blow.
Eh, but I dearly love to see you dance.

be ridiculous; but at this feast it merely evokes a kindly

approval. Part of the Cleitagora scolium is given in IV. 1245
