THE LYSISTRATA., 793-820
He detested women so.
We are of Melanion’s mind,
We detest the womankind.
MAN. May I, mother, kiss your cheek ?
woman. Then you won’t require a leek.*
M. Hoist my leg, and kick you, so?
Ww. Tie! what stalwart legs you show!
M. Just such stalwart legs and strong,
Just such stalwart legs as these,
To the noble chiefs belong,
Phormio ® and Myronides.¢
W. CH. Now to tell a little story
Fain, fain am I,
To your tale about Melanion
Take this reply.
How that once
Savage Timon, all forlorn,
Dwelt amongst the prickly thorn
Visage-shrouded, Fury-born.
Dwelt alone,
Far away,
Cursing men
Day by day ; °
Never saw his home again,
Kept aloof from haunts of men 3
Hating men of evil mind,
Dear to all the womankind.
Others render ‘‘ Then you shall never eat onions again,” a threat
like that of 689 (Schol.: ov ro\eujoes).
®’ Phormio, a naval hero of the Peloponnesian war; Myronides,
victor over the Corinthians and the Boeotians, 459-6 B.c. See
K. 562, P. 348, E. 304.
¢ It is now the women’s turn. The two systems are of course
antistrophical.
