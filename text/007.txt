THE LYSISTRATA, 17-43
One has to mind her husband : one, to rouse
Her servant: one, to put the child to sleep :
One, has to wash him: one, to give him pap.
ty. Ah! but they've other duties still more pressing

Ly. Pregnant, by Zeus.
CA. Why ever don’t we come, then ?
ty. No, it’s not that: we’d have come fast enough

Of all the States are anchored on us women.
ca. Anchored on us! a slender stay to lean on.

ca. Sure and ’tis better they should cease to be.
Ly. And all the dwellers in Boeotia perish—
ca. Except the eels; do pray except the eels.”
Ly. But about Athens, mark you, I won't utter
Such words as these : you must supply my meaning.
But if the women will but meet here now,
Boeotian girls, Peloponnesian girls,
And we ourselves, we'll save the States between us.
ca. What can we women do? What brilliant scheme
Can we, poor souls, accomplish ? we who sit
Nerrév (28) is the natural opposite to tax’. The allusion in 29 is
to the proverbial saying émi Newrijs édmldos dxeiobars; K. 1244.
