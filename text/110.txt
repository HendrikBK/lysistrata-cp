THE LYSISTRATA, 1247-1273
LAC.? Stir, Memory, stir the chiels
Wi’ that auld sang o’ thine,
Whilk kens what we an’ Attics did
In the gran’ fechts lang syne.
At Artemisium They
A’ resolute an’ strang
Rushed daurly to the fray,
Hurtlin’ like Gudes amang
The timmered ships, an’ put the Medes to rout.
An’ Us Leonidas led out
Like gruesome boars, I ween,
Whettin’ our tuskies keen.
Muckle around the chaps was the whitefreath gleamin ,
Muckle adoon the legs was the white freath streamin’,
For a’ unnumbered as the sands
Were they, thae Persian bands.
O Artemis, the pure, the chaste,
The virgin Queller o’ the beasties,
O come wi’ power an’ come wi’ haste,
An’ come to join our friendly feasties.
Come wi’ thy stoutest tether,
To knit our sauls thegither,
An’ gie us Peace in store,
An’ Luve for evermore.
Far hence, far hence depart
The tod’s deceitfu’ heart !
O virgin huntress, pure an’ chaste,
O come wi’ power, an’ come wi’ haste.
LY. There, all is settled, all arranged at last.
