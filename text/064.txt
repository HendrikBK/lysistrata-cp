THE LYSISTRATA, 677-699
If they do, I know the issue,
there’s an end of all the knights |!
Well a woman sticks on horseback :
look around you, see, behold,
Where on Micon’s living frescoes ¢
fight the Amazons of old!
Shall we let these wilful women,
O my brothers, do the same ?
Rather first their necks we'll rivet
tightly in the pillory framc.®
W. CH. If our smouldering fires ye wake,
Soon our wildbeast wrath will break
Out against you, and we'll make,
Make you how] to all your neighbours,
currycombed, poor soul, and tanned.
Throw aside your mantles, sisters,
come, a firm determined band,
In the odour of your wrathful
snappish womanhood to stand.
Who'll come forth and fight me ? garlic,
nevermore, nor beans ¢ for him.
Nay, if one sour word ye say,
I'll be like the midwife beetle,
Following till the eagle lay.4
Yea, for you and yours I reck not
whilst my Lampito survives,
And my noble, dear Ismenia,
loveliest of the Theban wives.
Keep decreeing seven times over,
not a bit of good you'll do,
Wretch abhorred of all the people
and of all our neighbours too.
