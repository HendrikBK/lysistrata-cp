INTRODUCTION

“Tn the autumn of 413 B.c. the news of the over-
whelming catastrophe in Sicily reached Athens, and the
Lysistrata was written in the year 412, at the very darkest
period of the Peloponnesian War, the darkest, that is to
say, before the ultimate disaster of Aegospotami, and
the consequent fall of Athens. It was produced at the
commencement of the year 411 B.c., but whether at the
Lenaea or at the Great Dionysia, and with what success,
the scanty record which has come down to us contains
nothing to show.” 4

In spite, however, of their difficulties, the Athenians
determined that they would not give in; they would
build a new navy in place of the fleets they had lost.
The sum of 1000 talents, held in reserve, was voted to
build the new fleet, timber and oar-spars being amongst
the articles most sorely needed, and amongst other
measures, “they appointed a Board of Ten Probuli, a
sort of Committee of Public Safety.”"® (In the play the
Probulus commands the Scythian archers, whom elsewhere
we find attending upon the BovA7; he comes to the
Acropolis to obtain the means of rebuilding the fleet ; he
directs the BovA;) to send plenipotentiaries to treat with
the Spartans.) ‘It was in a period of hopeless despond-
ency that Lysistrata developed her own original scheme
for a general pacification of the warring Hellenic states.” ¢
