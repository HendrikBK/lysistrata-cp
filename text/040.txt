THE LYSISTRATA, 444-468
"Fore Phosphorus, you'll need a cupping shortly.
maG. Tcha! what’s all this? lay hold of this one,
Archer !

I’ll stop this sallying out, depend upon it.
STRATYLLIS. And if he touch her, fore the Queen of Tauris,
I'll pull his squealing hairs out, one by one.

mac. O dear! all’s up! I’ve never an archer left.
Nay, but I swear we won't be done by women.
Come, Scythians, close your ranks, and all together
Charge !
LY. Charge away, my hearties, and you'll soon
Know that we've here, impatient for the fight,
Four woman-squadrons, armed from top to toe.
mac. Attack them, Scythians, twist their hands behind
them.
LY. Forth to the fray, dear sisters, bold allies !
O egg-and-seed-and-potherb-market-girls,
O garlic-selling-barmaid-baking-girls,
Charge to the rescue, smack and whack, and
thwack them,
Slang them, I say : show them what jades ye be.?
Fall back! retire! forbear to strip the slain.
mac. Hillo! my archers got the worst of that.
ty. What did the fool expect ? Was it to fight
With staves youcame? Think you we Women feel
No thirst for glory ?
MAG. Thirst enough, I trow ;
No doubt of that, when there’s a tavern handy.
M.cH. O thou who wastest many words,
Director of this nation,
Why wilt thou with such brutes as these
thus hold negotiation ?
