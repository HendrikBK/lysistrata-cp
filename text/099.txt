THE LYSISTRATA, 1102-1124
ATH. Ah, just the same as we.
Then let’s call out Lysistrata at once,
There’s none but she can make us friends again.
Lac. Ay, by the Twa, ca’ oot Lysistrata.?
ATH. Nay, here she is! no need, it seems, to call.
She heard your voices, and she comes uncalled.
cH. O Lady, noblest and best of all !
arise, arise, and thyself reveal,
Gentle, severe, attractive, harsh,
well skilled with all our complaints to deal,
The first and foremost of Hellas come,
they are caught by the charm of thy spell-drawn
wheel,¢
They come to Thee to adjust their claims,
disputes to settle, and strifes to heal.
ty. And no such mighty matter, if you take them
In Love’s first passion, still unsatisfied.
I'll try them now. Go, REconciLiaTIon,
Bring those Laconians hither, not with rude
Ungenial harshness hurrying them along,
Not in the awkward style our husbands used,
But with all tact, as only women can.
So; so: now bring me those Athenians too.?
Now then, Laconians, stand beside me here,
And you stand there, and listen to my words.
I am a woman, but I don’t lack sense ;

& Lysistrata comes forward attended by her handmaid Recon-
ciliation.

¢ Properly the wryneck, which was used in working charms ;
hence, a charm, or the wheel to which the bird was tied. See
Theocritus, Idylls, ii.

@ Line 1119 (omitted by R.): “If he won’t give his hand,
mentula prehensum duc.”’ Line 1121 (also omitted): ‘“‘ Take
hold of whatever they offer.”
