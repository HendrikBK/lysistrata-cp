Let them say so, man and woman,
Let them come with me.
Many purses, large and—empty,
In my house they'll see.
Only you must strictly promise,
Only you indeed must say
That whenever Peace re-greet us,
You will—not repay.
Some Carystian ¢ friends are coming,
Pleasant gentlemen, to dine ;
And I’ve made some soup, and slaughtered
Such a lovely swine ;
Luscious meat ye'll have and tender
At this feast of mine.
Come along, yourselves and children,
Come to grace my board to-day ;
Take an early bath, and deck you
In your best array ;
Then walk in and ask no questions,
Take the readiest way.
Come along, like men of mettle ;
Come as though 'twere all for you :
Come, you'll find my only entrance
Locked and bolted too.®
Lo here from Sparta the envoys come :
in a pitiful plight they are hobbling in.¢
Heavily hangs each reverend beard ;
heavily droops and trails from the chin.
Laconian envoys ! first I bid you welcome,
And next I ask how goes the world with you ? |
» The Laconian ambassadors are seen approaching.
¢ Quasi porcorum caveam ante femora habent.
