THE LYSISTRATA, 1032-1052
Just look ! don’t you think
‘tis a Tricorysian ? gnat ?
m.cH. And he’s been dig, dig. digging
(so I thank you much for that)
Till the water, now he’s gone,
keeps running from my eye
w. cH. But although you've been so naughty,
I'll come and wipe it dry,
And I'll kiss you.
M. CH. No, not kiss me !
W. CH. Will you, nill you, it must be.
mM. cH. Get along, a murrain on you.
Tcha! what coaxing rogues are ye !
That was quite a true opinion
which a wise man gave about you,
We can’t live with such tormentors,
no, by Zeus, nor yet without you.
Now we'll make a faithful treaty,
and for evermore agree,
I will do no harm to women,
they shall do no harm to me.
Join our forces, come along’:
one and all commence the song
JoInT cH.2 Not to objurgate and scold you,
Not unpleasant truths to say,
But with words and deeds of bounty
Come we here to-day.
Ah, enough of idle quarrels,
Now attend, I pray.
Now whoever wants some money,
Minas two or minas three,
of pleasantry ; consisting of large and liberal offers made by the
Chorus, but with an intimation at the end that they have no means
or intention of performing them”: R.
101
