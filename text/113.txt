Twirlin’ licht the fleecy skin ;

Sae we’se join our blithesome voices,

Praisin’ Sparta, loud an’ lang,

Sparta wha of auld rejoices

In the Choral dance an’ sang.

O to watch her bonnie dochters

Sport alang Eurotas’ waters !

Winsome feet for ever plyin’,

Fleet as fillies, wild an’ gay,

Winsome tresses tossin’, flyin’,

As o’ Bacchanals at play.

Leda’s dochter, on before us,

Pure an’ sprety, guides the Chorus.
Onward go,

Whilst your eager hand represses

A’ the glory o’ your tresses ;

Whilst your eager foot is springin’
Like the roe ;

Whilst your eager voice is singin’

Praise to Her in might excellin’

Goddess o’ the Brassin Dwellin’.
