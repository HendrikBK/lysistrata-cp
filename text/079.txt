MY. (within) Ay, ay, I love, I love him, but he won’t
Be loved by me: call me not out to him.?
cr. What mean you, Myrrhina, my sweet, sweet love ¢
Do, do come down.
MY. No, no, sir, not to you.
cr. What, won't you when I call you, Myrrhina ?
my. Why, though: you call me, yet you want me not.
c1. Not want you, Myrrhina! I’m dying for you.
My. Good-bye.
Cl. Nay, nay, but listen to the child
At all events : speak to Mama, my child.
cHILD. Mama! Mama! Mama!
ci. Have you no feeling, mother, for your child,
Six days unwashed, unsuckled ?
MY. ° Ay, ‘tis I
That feel for baby, ‘tis Papa neglects him.
ct. Come down and take him, then?
MY. O what it is
To be amother! I must needs go down.”
c1. She looks, methinks, more youthful than she did,
More gentle-loving, and more sweet by far.
Her very airs, her petulant, saucy ways,
They do but make me love her, love her more.
my. O my sweet child, a naughty father’s child,
Mama’s own darling, let me kiss you, pet.
c1. Why treat me thus, you baggage, letting others
Lead you astray : making me miserable
And yourself too ?
MY. Hands off ! don’t touch me, sir.
cr. And all our household treasures, yours and mine,
Are gone to wrack and ruin.
MY. I don’t care.

through the gate. While she is gone Cinesias speaks.
