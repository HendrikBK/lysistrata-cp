THE LYSISTRATA, 263-286
As the City Castle by force to hold,
With block and bolt and barrier vast,
Making the Propylaea fast.
Press on, Philurgus, towards the heights ;
we'll pile a great amazing
Array of logs around the walls,
- and set them all a-blazing :
And as for these conspirators,
a bonfire huge we'll make them,
One vote shall doom the whole to death,
one funeral pyre shall take them,
And thus we'll burn the brood accurst, )
but Lycon’s wife? we’ll burn the first.
No, never, never, whilst I live,
shall woman-folk deride me :
Not scatheless went Cleomenes,?
when he like this defied me,
And dared my castle to seize: yet He,
A Spartan breathing contempt and pride,
Full soon surrendered his arms to me,
And a scanty coat round his loins he tied,
And with unwashed limbs, and with unkempt head,
And with six years’ dirt, the intruder fled ;
So strict and stern a watch around
my mates and I were keeping,
In seventeen rows of serried shields
before the fortress sleeping.
And THESE, whom both Euripides
and all the Powers on high
Alike detest, shall these, shall these,
my manly rage defy ?
Then never be my Trophy shown,
on those red plains of Marathon !
But over this snubby protruding steep
