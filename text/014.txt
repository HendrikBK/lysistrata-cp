THE LYSISTRATA, 110-136
So will you, will you, if I find a way,
Help me to end the war ?
MY. Ay, that we will.
I will, be sure, though I'd to fling me down
This mantling shawl, and have a bout of—drinking ?
ca. And I would cleave my very self in twain
Like a cleft turbot,’ and give half for Peace.
ta. An’ I, to glint at Peace again, wad speel
Up to the tap rig o’ Taygety.
ty. I'll tell you now: ’tis meet ye all should know.
O ladies! sisters! if we really mean .
To make the men make Peace, there’s but one way,
We must abstain—
MY. Well! tell us.
LY. Will ye do it?
My. Doit? ay, surely, though it cost our lives.
ty. We must abstain—each—from the joys of Love.
How! what! why turn away ? where are ye going ?
What makes you pout your lips, and shake your heads?
What brings this falling tear, that changing colour ?
Will ye, or will ye not? What mean ye, eh?
my. I'll never do it. Let the war go on.
ca. Zeus! nor I either. Let the war go on.
Ly. You, too, Miss Turbot ? you who said just now
You’d cleave, for Peace, your very self in twain ?
ca. Ask anything but this. Why, if needs be,
I’d walk through fire : only, not give up Love.
There’s nothing like it, dear Lysistrata.
ty. And what say you?

throughout this scene, playing upon the alleged bibulous pro-
pensities of Athenian women”: R.
