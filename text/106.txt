THE. LYSISTRATA, 1201-1222
Quick partition make.
Only, if you find the treasures,
Only, if the stores you spy,
You must have, I tell you plainly,
Keener sight than I.
Is THERE any man among you,
With a lot of children small,
With a crowd of hungry servants,
Starving in his hall ?
I have wheat to spare in plenty,
I will feed them all.
Loaves, a quart apiece, I'll give them,
Come along, whoever will,
Bring your bags, and bring your wallets
For my slave to fill ;
Manes, he’s the boy to pack them
Tight and tighter still.
Only you must keep your distance,
Only you must needs take care,
Only—don’t approach my doorway,
Ware the watch-dog, ware! 4
IDLER. Open the door there, ho !
PORTER. Be off, you rascal !
1p. What, won't you stir? I’ve half a mind to roast you

All with this torch. No, that’s a vulgar trick.

I won’t do that. Still if the audience wish it,

To please their tastes we'll undertake the task.
SECOND IDLER. And we, with you, will undertake the task.
por. Hang you, be off! what are you at? you'll catch it

* Some idlers come in from the market-place, and attempt to enter
the house in which the ambassadors are feasting.
