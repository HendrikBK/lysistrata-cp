THE LYSISTRATA, 594-613
mac. Men, I suppose, have their youth everlastingly.
LY, Nay, but it isn’t the same with a man:
- Grey though he be when he comes from the battle-
field, still if he wishes to marry, he can.
Brief is the spring and the flower of our womanhood,
once let it slip, and it comes not again ;
Sit as we may with our spells and our auguries,
never a husband will marry us then.
MAG. Truly whoever is able to wed—*
LY. Truly, old fellow, ‘tis time you were dead.
So a pigshall be sought, and anurnshall be bought,
And I’ll bake you and make you a funeral cake.’
Take it and go.
CA. Here are the fillets all ready to wear.
MY. Here is the chaplet to bind in your hair.
LY. Take it and go.
What are you prating for ?
What are you waiting for?
Charon is staying, delaying his crew,
Charon is calling and bawling for you.°
mMaG. See, here’s an outrage! here’s ascandalous shame!
I'll run and show my fellow magistrates
The woeful, horrid, dismal plight I’m in.
ty. | Grumbling because we have not laid you out ?
Wait for three days, and then with dawn will come,
All in good time, the third-day 4 funeral rites.¢
¢ Probably a reminiscence of Eur. Alc. 260 ff.
@ The body was laid out, and ceremonies performed on the
third and ninth days (rpira, évara).
¢ The Magistrate runs off in his grave-clothes to complain of and
exhibit the treatment he has received. Lysistrata and her friends
withdraw into the Acropolis. The two Choruses remain without,
and relieve the tedium of the siege with 2 little banter
