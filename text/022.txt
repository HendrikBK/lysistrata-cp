THE LYSISTRATA, 238-262
CA. Shares, my friend,
Now at first starting let us show we're fricnds.
La. Hark! what’s yon skirlin’ ?¢
Ly. That’s the thing I said.
They've seized the Acropolis, Athene’s castle,
Our comrades have. Now, Lampito, be off :
You, go to Sparta, and arrange things there,
Leaving us here these girls as hostages.
And We will pass inside the castle walls,
And help the women there to close the bars.
ca. But don’t you think that very soon the Men
Will come, in arms, against us ?
Ly. Let them come !
They will not bring or threats or fire enough
To awe our woman hearts, and make us open
These gates again, save on the terms we mentioned.
ca. By Aphrodite, no! else ’twere for nought
That people call us bold, resistless jades.®
CHORUS OF MEN.
On, sure and slow, my Draces, go:
though that great log you're bringing
Of olive green, is sore, I ween,
your poor old shoulder wringing.
O dear, how many things in life
belie one’s expectations !
Since who'd have thought, my Strymodore,
that these abominations,
Who would have thought that sluts like these,
Our household pests, would have waxed so bold,
As the Holy Image by fraud to seize,
logs of firewood, and a jar of lighted cinders ; and as they move,
they sing their entrance song.
¢ The sacrosanct image of Athene Polias, which fell from
heaven.
VOL, IIT B 27
